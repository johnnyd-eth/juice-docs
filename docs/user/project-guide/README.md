:::tip About
***Juicebox lets you launch an Ethereum-based treasury for your project, and evolve its rules over time.***
:::

## Launch Your Project

All you need to get started is an Ethereum wallet and some ETH to cover gas fees. You can get a free Ethereum wallet and buy ETH with [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/).

Start by connecting your wallet to [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money) and clicking `Launch your project`. You can enter information on the left side of your screen—the right side is a preview. The NFT which represents your project will be minted to your wallet once you create your project. You can send this NFT to a multisig or another address if you would like to transfer your project's ownership.

:::info
Consider creating a test project on the [Goerli testnet version of Juicebox](https://goerli.juicebox.money/) before creating a mainnet project. If you need help deciding how to configure your project, ask in the [Juicebox DAO Discord](https://discord.gg/juicebox).
