# Subgraph

[juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money) uses [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) to load data from Juicebox protocol contracts without directly querying the blockchain.

Multiple subgraphs are maintained by [Peel](https://discord.gg/b4rpjgGPHX) in a Graph Studio owned by the [Peel Gnosis safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x0e9D15e28e3De9bB3CF64FFbC2f2F49Da9Ac545B). Only the primary Juicebox subgraph has been published to the Graph Network; others are available to use for free with rate-limited queries.

:::note Querying the subgraph
**The Juicebox subgraph schema is the same on all networks**, and can be found on the following page. For information on structuring Graph queries, read the [Graph docs](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/querying-the-graph/). You can also reference the [tools used for juicebox.money](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/blob/5117545d17c7c2336207381be5b1c46f67fad459/src/utils/graph.ts#L240).

## Avoid Rate-Limiting

To use the mainnet Juicebox subgraph without being rate-limited:

1. Create your API key on [Subgraph Studio API Keys](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/).
2. Fund your billing balance on [Subgraph Studio Billing](https://thegraph.com/studio/billing/).
3. Query the mainnet Juicebox subgraph using `https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/<your-api-key>/subgraphs/id/FVmuv3TndQDNd2BWARV8Y27yuKKukryKXPzvAS5E7htC`.

You can also follow the [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrfIpm-Vlgs).
